<P>Industry
Industries are economic activities that produce goods, extract minerals, and provide services. A country's wealth is largely based on its industry, and the more productive the industry, the greater the national wealth. 
Industrialization
Industrialization is the process of transitioning an economy from agriculture to manufacturing. It involves mechanized mass production and can lead to economic growth, a more efficient division of labor, and technological innovation. 
Industrial Revolution
The Industrial Revolution took place in two parts, the First Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century to about 1830, and the Second Industrial Revolution in the mid-19th century until the early 20th century. The Industrial Revolution led to the mass production of goods, which became less expensive and available in greater quantities.</P><Br>
